=== Generator Section
In the generator section the user defines how to generate the data for a field.

.example from a decision table

==== Generator command
The generator is used to generate new data.

----
gen:<instanceId>:<generatorName>:<any Parameter>
----

instanceId::
	The instance id is an internal id for creating a an instance of a given test case. If no Id is given
	a uuid will be taken by the generator. The instance id allows the user to get the same data set from
	a generator on different fields. +
  For Example there is a generator which creates personal data.
	It will generate a 'firstName', 'lastName' and a email. But the data is needed in three different fields of the table.
	Each time the generator is called it normally creates a new set of data. But this is not what is needed in this case.
  +
  Assume the data generator is named ''AdressDataGenerator'' and it has a parameter to tell which data to be returned.

----
gen:1:AdressDataGenerator:firstName  <1>

gen:1:AdressDataGenerator:lastName   <2>

gen:1:AdressDataGenerator:email      <3>
----
<1> The first call of the generator. It will create a new set of data. The data
will be stores under the instanceId ''1'' And the data for the field ''firstName'' is
returned.
<2> The second call of the generator. The generator find data for the instance id ''1''
and will not generator new data. Then it will return the data for ''lastName''
<3> The same as for 2.

The instanceId allows the user to call the same generator many times but got access to
the same data if needed.


==== Reference command
The reference allows the user to chain tables together.

----
ref:<instanceId>:<tableName>:<fieldName>:<testcaseName>
----

There are two cases for a reference. A reference to an other table or to the same table.
For example there is a table with a person record. And there is a field ''friend email''.
If a person should be created where the email of a friend is associated the data for this
friend is also needed. When this is done by a reference the generator will create two
record of person.

Preconditions::
* There is a table called ''Person''
* There is a field named ''email''
* There is a field named ''friend'' which should be filled with an existing email
of an other person.
* There is a test case called ''valid''.


.example reference for the field ''friend''
----
ref:1:Person:email:valid
----

So for one test case the generator creates two dataset. One for the person and one
for the friend.

[WARNING]
When using references you must avoid cyclic calls. The generator will detect this,
but it will lead to an error.

===== Special kinds of references

Reference without a field::
----
ref::Person::tc1
----
This causes the generator to generate the dependent data but do not copy
into this current data set.


Reference with a range::
----
ref::Person:email:[tc1-5]
----
A range is given by putting the testcase name into ''[]'' squared brackets.
This will cause that the current test will be created as many times as the
reference defines. In this case 5 times.

[NOTE]
If a range is given the instanceIdSuffix must be undefined.


Self references::
A self reference references an other field in the same test case. A good example
for this is for the second password in a registration dialog.
There the second password must be the same as the first one.

.Field password2
----
ref::Person:password:
----

[NOTE]
For a self reference the test case name and the instanceIdSuffix must be undefined.


.without table name
----
ref:::password:
----
Also the table name could be omitted.



==== Empty fields or literals
If the generator field is left empty the validator will complain about this.
So every field needs a value. If a literal is entered, then this value is taken.
