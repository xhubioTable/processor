The processor takes one table after an other. In each table it looks for executable
entries. Then it will execute each of these.
If one of them is a references to an other table than this reference will also be executed.

After one test case is finished it will call all the exporters for this test case.

=== Usage

[source, js]

import {Processor} from '@xhubio/table-processor'

const opts 0 {
	generators: {}, <1>
	exporters: [],  <2>
	tables: {},     <3>
}

const processor = new Processor(opts)
processor.process()

----
