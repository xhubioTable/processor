== Writer Interface

The Writer is responsible for exporting the generated test case data in the required format. It is best practice to implement one writer per target format or data type.

=== Constructor

The constructor initializes the writer and sets up the logger. The logger is used for writing logs throughout the writer's lifecycle.

[source, js]
----
constructor(opts = {}) {
  this.logger = opts.logger || getLoggerMemory()
}
----
*Example:*  
You can log information within the writer using:
[source, js]
----
this.logger.info('My important info')
----

=== before

The `before()` method is called once when the processor starts processing test cases. It is intended for any necessary setup or initialization (e.g., opening a file, establishing a connection, etc.).

[source, js]
----
async before() {
  console.log(`Start a new processing`)
}
----

=== after

The `after()` method is invoked after all test cases have been processed. It is meant for any necessary teardown or cleanup tasks (e.g., closing connections, writing final summary, etc.).

[source, js]
----
async after() {
  console.log(`End processing`)
}
----

=== write

The `write()` method is the core of the Writer interface. It is called once for each test case and receives a test case data object containing all generated data for that test case. It is the writer's responsibility to extract and export the data in the desired format.

[source, js]
----
async write(testcaseData) {
  console.log(
    `Write testcase '${testcaseData.name}' for table '${testcaseData.tableName}'`
  )
}
----
